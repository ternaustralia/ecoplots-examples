The Williams Wet Tropics vertebrate data set contains records of raw species occurrence records for 144 species of the  350 odd species that are known to occurr in the Australian Wet Tropics Bioregion. The data set was 
compiled by Williams 2006 (https://rainforest-crc.jcu.edu.au/publications/vertebrate_distributions_full.pdf) and is structured based on feature types and parameters and archived on the TERN EcoPlots (https://ecoplots.tern.org.au/search). 
In this example, we show how to extract information from an API query snippet on EcoPlots and explore and visualise data in R studio.
